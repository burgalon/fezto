# Frontend Zero to One
An automatic on-the-fly app generator from OpenAPI 3.0 spec (or Swagger 2.0) 

FEZTO parses the OpenAPI spec and tries to determine which resources are available to present, and creates CRUD screen for creating, reading and updating entities. It also tries to resolve foreign keys to create dropdowns and add linkable resources.
